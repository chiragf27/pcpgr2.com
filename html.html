 <b><h1>VARIOUS WAYS TO TROUBLESHOOT MOTHERBOARD </h1></b> </marquee> </p>
<p>The motherboard and processor are two of the most important hardware components inside the computer. The various pieces of hardware inside the PC communicate with one another through the circuits on the motherboard, while the CPU stores and executes programming instructions.

</p>
<h3>Turnrn off the computer</h3>
<ul>  
<li>Disconnect the power cable from the back of the PC. Unscrew and remove the cover from the case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Touch a Bare Metal Surface</h3>
<p><ul><li>Touch a bare metal surface, such as the computer chassis, to ground yourself.</li></ul>
</p>
<h3>Turn on the Computer
</h3>
<p><ul><li>Reconnect the power cable and then turn on the computer. Listen to the internal speaker for a sequence of beeps (call beep codes) that the motherboard produces when the system detects a problem with a critical hardware component.</li></ul>
<h3>Navigate to Motherboard Manufacturer's Website
</h3>
<ul><li>Open a browser and navigate to the motherboard manufacturer's website. Look up the motherboard model and review the documentation for the component to find out which device is responsible for the beep code, if applicable. Confirm that the device is properly installed to the motherboard. If resetting the hardware fails to fix the problem, you might need to replace the component.</ul></li>
<h3>Turn off the Computer

</h3>
<ul><li>Power off the computer if the PC fails to emit a beep code. Disconnect the power cable and all peripheral components connected to the rear of the PC.</ul></li>
<h3>Uninstall Hardware


</h3>
<ul><li>Uninstall all hardware from the computer except for the motherboard, CPU, power supply, hard drive and video card.</ul></li>
<h3>Loosen the Heat Sink and Processor Fan


</h3>
<ul><li>Loosen and remove the brackets securing the heat sink and processor fan to the CPU. Twist the heat sink back and forth to weaken the seal binding the component to the top of the processor.</ul></li>
<h3>Touch the Processor



</h3>
<ul><li>Extract the heat sink from the PC. Put a finger on the processor. If the component is too hot to touch for longer than a couple seconds, the CPU might be overheating. Upgrading the heat sink assembly will improve cooling and stop sudden system shutdowns.</ul></li>

<h3>Lift Out the CPU



</h3>

<ul><li>Release the bar securing the CPU to the motherboard. Lift the CPU out of the computer and check the surface of the component for bent or broken pins, which indicate that the hardware should be replaced.</ul></li>

<h3>Lock the CPU in Place



</h3>
<ul><li>Line up the triangle on the edge of the processor with the triangle on the processor slot. Place the CPU on top of the slot and then push down the bar to lock the component in place.</ul></li>
<h3>Reconnect the Power
</h3>
<ul><li>Reconnect the power cable and press the power button. Check the power indicator light and listen for the spinning of the system fan. If the indicator light remains off and the system fan fails to power up, the power supply unit might be defective. Replace the PSU; if the computer still fails to power on, the motherboard might be at fault.</ul></li>
<h3>Check for Damage on Motherboard

</h3>
<ul><li>Shine a flashlight on the motherboard and check for broken onboard chips, damaged capacitors (which look similar to an AA battery), burnt traces (the lines traveling along the surface of the board), or cracks or fractures in the board itself. If the motherboard has incurred physical damage, it must be replaced.</ul></li>

<h3>Remove the CLRTC Jumper
</h3>
<ul><li>Turn off the computer. Locate a jumper labeled "CLRTC" or similar. Use a pair of tweezers to remove the shunt from the first two pins. Place the shunt on pins two and three, wait 10 seconds, and then return the jumper to its original configuration.</ul></li>
<h3> Reconnect the Keyboard

</h3>
<ul><li>Reconnect the keyboard to the computer and then restart the PC. Follow the instructions on the boot screen to go to setup.</ul></li>
<h3>Load Fail-Safe Defaults

</h3>
<ul><li>Press the button as shown on the main menu to load fail-safe defaults or use the directional pad to select the appropriate option and then press "Enter."</ul></li>
<h3>Restart the Computer
</h3



</p>
<p><ul><li>Press "F10" or go to "Save and Exit" and then press "Enter" to restart the computer. If the computer still fails to boot properly, or if the same issues occur after loading the operating system, the motherboard or CPU might need to be replaced.</ul></li>
