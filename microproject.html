<h1 align="center">Components on the motherboard</h1>
<p> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><b>PCI Slot (peripheral component interconnect)</b> 
	</p>
	<p>The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot is an interface
	device for the 32-bit computer bus. These tools are integrated on
	the computer motherboard and can be used to allow the addition of
	PCI devices. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>PCI-E 16X slot</b> 
	</p>
	<p>PCIe x16 is a slot on a motherboard that has 16 data links known
	as PCIe lanes. This is a slot with the highest throughput rate and
	can be occupied with expansion cards that have a very high bandwidth
	requirement such as graphics card.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>PCI E 1X slot</b> 
	</p>
	<p>PCIe x1 slot is used to plug in low demanding PCIe expansion
	cards that do not have a very high throughput (transfer rate) such
	as Network Adapters, Port Expansion Cards, Sound Cards and Certain
	Riser Cards.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>Northbridge</b> 
	</p>
	<p>Northbridge is an Intel chipset that communicates with the
	computer processor and controls interaction with memory, the
	Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus, Level 2 cache, and all
	Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) activities. Northbridge communicates
	with the processor using the frontside bus (FSB).</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>ATX 12V &amp; 4 pin power connection</b> 
	</p>
	<p>The purpose of this new connector is to deliver more +12V current
	to the motherboard than is available from the standard ATX main
	power connector. The presence of the 4-pin +12V connector indicates
	that a power supply is ATX12V. The absence of that connector
	indicates that it is a standard ATX power supply.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>CPU Fan connection</b> 
	</p>
	<p>A motherboard fan connector is a small three or four-pin
	connector located on the motherboard. The fan will have one set of
	cables (bundled together) that will connect into the connector on
	the motherboard.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>Socket</b> 
	</p>
	<p>A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between
	two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port
	number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data
	is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP
	address and a port number.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>DIMM slot</b> 
	</p>
	<p>DIMM (dual in-line memory module) slots are the place on your
	motherboard where the RAM goes. As such, you may also see DIMM slots
	referred to as “RAM slots.” The more DIMM slots your motherboard
	has, the more RAM you can install.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>ATX power connector</b> 
	</p>
	<p>An ATX style connector is a replacement for the older P8 and P9
	AT style connector. It is one of the largest connectors inside a
	computer. It connects a power supply to an ATX style motherboard. As
	shown in the picture, the 20-pin cable is a multi-color cable and
	may be labeled as P1.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>IDE conductor or PATA connector</b> 
	</p>
	<p>IDE, an acronym for Integrated Drive Electronics, is a standard
	type of connection for storage devices in a computer. Generally, IDE
	refers to the types of cables and ports used to connect some hard
	drives and optical drives to each other and to the motherboard. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>Southbridge</b> 
	</p>
	<p>The southbridge is one of the two chips in the core logic chipset
	on a personal computer motherboard, the other being the northbridge.
	The southbridge typically implements the slower capabilities of the
	motherboard in a northbridge/southbridge chipset computer
	architecture. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>SATA connection</b> 
	</p>
	<p>SATA ports are generally known as connectors, and they are used
	to connect hard drives to motherboards. There are two SATA ports on
	the motherboard. They are designed to carry data between the
	motherboard and the drive, using a SATA data cable.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>Front panel connection</b> 
	</p>
	<p>The Front Panel Connectors, also known as the Front Panel Header
	or FPanel, is a block of connectors on a motherboard that control
	the power on, power reset, beep code speaker and the LED light
	indicators on your PC case/chassis.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>FDD connector</b> 
	</p>
	<p>An FDD connector is a pin ribbon connector that connects a floppy
	disk drive with the computer’s motherboard. This connector also
	provides a route through which data on the floppy disk can be read
	and displayed on the computer’s interface.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>External USB cnonnection</b> 
	</p>
	<p>Almost all modern Laptop/notebook computers are equipped with USB
	ports, but an external USB hub can consolidate several everyday
	devices (like a mouse, keyboard or printer) into a single hub to
	enable one-step attachment and removal of all the devices.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>CMOS battery</b> 
	</p>
	<p>The CMOS battery powers your laptop's BIOS firmware, which is
	responsible for booting up your computer and configuring data flow.
	You can tell if your CMOS battery has died if your laptop has
	difficult booting up, if drivers disappear, and if your laptop's
	date and time are incorrect.</p>
